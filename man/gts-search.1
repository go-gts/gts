.SH "NAME"
\fBgts\-search\fR \- search for a subsequence and annotate its results
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
gts\-search [\-\-version] [\-h | \-\-help] [\fIargs\fR] \fIquery\fR \fIseqin\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBgts\-search\fR takes a \fIquery\fR and a single input sequence, and marks the regions where the \fIquery\fR sequences were found\. If the sequence input is ommited, standard input will be read instead\. If a file with a filename equivalent to the \fIquery\fR value exists, it will be opened and read by the command\. If it does not, the command will interpret the \fIquery\fR string as a sequence\. The \fIquery\fR sequence(s) will be treated as an oligomer\. In order to find perfect matches only, use the \fB\-e\fR or \fB\-\-exact\fR option\. By default, regions are marked as \fBmisc_feature\fRs without any qualifiers\. Use the \fB\-k\fR or \fB\-\-key\fR option and \fB\-q\fR or \fB\-\-qualifier\fR option so you can easily discover these features later on with gts\-select(1)\. See the EXAMPLES section for more insight\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB<query>\fR
Query sequence file (will be interpreted literally if preceded with @)\. See gts\-seqin(7) for a list of currently supported list of sequence formats\.
.
.TP
\fB<seqin>\fR
Input sequence file (may be omitted if standard input is provided)\. See gts\-seqin(7) for a list of currently supported list of sequence formats\.
.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-exact\fR
Match the exact pattern even for ambiguous letters\.
.
.TP
\fB\-F <format>\fR, \fB\-\-format=<format>\fR
Output file format (defaults to same as input)\. See gts\-seqout(7) for a list of currently supported list of sequence formats\. The format specified with this option will override the file type detection from the output filename\.
.
.TP
\fB\-k <key>\fR, \fB\-\-key=<key>\fR
Key for the reported oligomer region features\. The default feature key is \fBmisc_feature\fR\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-cache\fR
Do not use or create cache\. See gts\-cache(7) for details\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-complement\fR
Do not match the complement strand\.
.
.TP
\fB\-o <output>\fR, \fB\-\-output=<output>\fR
Output sequence file (specifying \fB\-\fR will force standard output)\. The output file format will be automatically detected from the filename if none is specified with the \fB\-F\fR or \fB\-\-format\fR option\.
.
.TP
\fB\-q <qualifier>\fR, \fB\-\-qualifier=<qualifier>\fR
Qualifier key\-value pairs (syntax: key=value))\. Multiple values may be set by repeatedly passing this option to the command\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Search for \fIquery\fR and retrieve the regions 100 bases around the matches\.
