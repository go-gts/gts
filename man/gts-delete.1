.TH "GTS\-DELETE" "1" "October 2020" "" ""
.
.SH "NAME"
\fBgts\-delete\fR \- delete a region of the given sequence(s)
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
gts\-delete [\-\-version] [\-h | \-\-help] [\fIargs\fR] \fIlocator\fR \fIseqin\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBgts\-delete\fR takes a single sequence input and deletes the specified region\. The region to be deleted is specified using a \fBlocator\fR\. A locator is a combination of one of \fBpoint location\fR, \fBrange location\fR, or \fBselector\fR, and a \fBmodifier\fR in the form \fB[selector|point|range][@modifier]\fR\. See gts\-locator(7) for a more in\-depth explanation of a locator\. Refer to the EXAMPLES for some examples to get started\.
.
.P
Features that were present in the region being deleted will be shifted as being in between the bases at the deletion point\. Such features can be completely erased from the sequence if the \fB\-e\fR or \fB\-\-erase\fR option is provided\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB<locator>\fR
A locator string ([selector|point|range][@modifier])\. See gts\-locator(7) for more details\.
.
.TP
\fB<seqin>\fR
Input sequence file (may be omitted if standard input is provided)\. See gts\-seqin(7) for a list of currently supported list of sequence formats\.
.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-erase\fR
Remove features contained in the deleted regions\.
.
.TP
\fB\-F <format>\fR, \fB\-\-format=<format>\fR
Output file format (defaults to same as input)\. See gts\-seqout(7) for a list of currently supported list of sequence formats\. The format specified with this option will override the file type detection from the output filename\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-cache\fR
Do not use or create cache\. See gts\-cache(7) for details\.
.
.TP
\fB\-o <output>\fR, \fB\-\-output=<output>\fR
Output sequence file (specifying \fB\-\fR will force standard output)\. The output file format will be automatically detected from the filename if none is specified with the \fB\-F\fR or \fB\-\-format\fR option\.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$ gts delete \-\-erase misc_feature <seqin>
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Delete 20 bases upstream of every \fBCDS\fR:

.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$ gts delete CDS^\-20\.\.^ <seqin>
