.SH "NAME"
\fBgts\-repair\fR \- repair fragmented features
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
gts\-repair [\-\-version] [\-h | \-\-help] [\fIargs\fR] \fIseqin\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBgts\-repair\fR takes a single input sequence and attempts to reconstruct features that have been fragmented as a result of other manipulations\. Specifically, \fBgts\-repair\fR will scan each sequence to find features that have identical feature keys and qualifier key\-value pairs, check if their locations are pointing to a consecutive region of the sequence, and if they are, merge the locations to create a single feature\. Any features that has been lost as a result of other manipulations will not be reconstructed\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB<seqin>\fR
Input sequence file (may be omitted if standard input is provided)\. See gts\-seqin(7) for a list of currently supported list of sequence formats\.
.
.TP
\fB\-F <format>\fR, \fB\-\-format=<format>\fR
Output file format (defaults to same as input)\. See gts\-seqout(7) for a list of currently supported list of sequence formats\. The format specified with this option will override the file type detection from the output filename\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-cache\fR
Do not use or create cache\. See gts\-cache(7) for details\.
.
.TP
\fB\-o <output>\fR, \fB\-\-output=<output>\fR
Output sequence file (specifying \fB\-\fR will force standard output)\. The output file format will be automatically detected from the filename if none is specified with the \fB\-F\fR or \fB\-\-format\fR option\.
.
.SH "BUGS"
\fBgts\-repair\fR currently has no known bugs\.
.
.SH "AUTHORS"
\fBgts\-repair\fR is written and maintained by Kotone Itaya\.
