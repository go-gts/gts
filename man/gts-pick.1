.
.SH "NAME"
\fBgts\-pick\fR \- pick sequence(s) from multiple sequences
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
gts\-pick [\-\-version] [\-h | \-\-help] [\fIargs\fR] \fIlist\fR \fIseqin\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBgts\-pick\fR takes a single sequence input and returns the sequences specified by the \fIlist\fR option\. The \fIlist\fR option is equivalent to that of cut(1)\. Sequence numbering starts at 1\. Specifying the \fB\-f\fR or \fB\-\-feature\fR option will output all sequences but pick the features matching the \fIlist\fR option\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB<list>\fR
List of sequences to pick (identical to the list option in cut)\. A list is a comma separated set of numbers and/or number ranges\. Number ranges consist of a number, a dash character \fB\-\fR, and a second number\. A number range will select the sequences from the first number to the second, inclusive\. Numbers may be preceded by a dash, which selects all sequences from 1 up to the number\. Numbers may be followed by a dash, which selects all sequences from the number to the last\.
.
.TP
\fB<seqin>\fR
Input sequence file (may be omitted if standard input is provided)\. See gts\-seqin(7) for a list of currently supported list of sequence formats\.
.
.TP
\fB\-F <format>\fR, \fB\-\-format=<format>\fR
Output file format (defaults to same as input)\. See gts\-seqout(7) for a list of currently supported list of sequence formats\. The format specified with this option will override the file type detection from the output filename\.
.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-feature\fR
Pick features instead of sequences\.
.
.TP
\fB\-o <output>\fR, \fB\-\-output=<output>\fR
Output sequence file (specifying \fB\-\fR will force standard output)\. The output file format will be automatically detected from the filename if none is specified with the \fB\-F\fR or \fB\-\-format\fR option\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Pick the first sequence in the file:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$ gts pick 1 <seqin>
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Pick the first ten features from each sequence in the file:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$ gts pick \-f \-10 <seqin>
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "BUGS"
