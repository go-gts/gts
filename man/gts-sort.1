.SH "NAME"
\fBgts\-sort\fR \- sort the list of sequences
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
gts\-sort [\-\-version] [\-h | \-\-help] [\fIargs\fR] \fIseqin\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBgts\-sort\fR takes a single sequence input and sorts the sequences\. If the sequence input is ommited, standard input will be read instead\. By default, the sequences will be sorted from longest to shortest\. It is advised against to use this command on files with large numbers of sequences\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB<seqin>\fR
Input sequence file (may be omitted if standard input is provided)\. See gts\-seqin(7) for a list of currently supported list of sequence formats\.
.
.TP
\fB\-F <format>\fR, \fB\-\-format=<format>\fR
Output file format (defaults to same as input)\. See gts\-seqout(7) for a list of currently supported list of sequence formats\. The format specified with this option will override the file type detection from the output filename\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-cache\fR
Do not use or create cache\. See gts\-cache(7) for details\.
.
.TP
\fB\-o <output>\fR, \fB\-\-output=<output>\fR
Output sequence file (specifying \fB\-\fR will force standard output)\. The output file format will be automatically detected from the filename if none is specified with the \fB\-F\fR or \fB\-\-format\fR option\.
.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-reverse\fR
Reverse the sort order\.
.
.SH "BUGS"
