.SH "NAME"
\fBgts\-join\fR \- join the sequences contained in the files
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
gts\-join [\-\-version] [\-h | \-\-help] [\fIargs\fR] \fIseqin\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBgts\-join\fR takes a single input sequence and joins its contents into a single sequence\. If the sequence input is ommited, standard input will be read instead\. This command will make no attempt to restore features that originated from a single sequence which is fragmented across different entries\. To repair such features, first run \fBgts\-join\fR and pass the output to gts\-repair(1)\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.TP
\fB<seqin>\fR
Input sequence file (may be omitted if standard input is provided)\. See gts\-seqin(7) for a list of currently supported list of sequence formats\.
.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-circular\fR
Output the sequence as circular if possible\.
.
.TP
\fB\-F <format>\fR, \fB\-\-format=<format>\fR
Output file format (defaults to same as input)\. See gts\-seqout(7) for a list of currently supported list of sequence formats\. The format specified with this option will override the file type detection from the output filename\.

.TP
\fB\-\-no\-cache\fR
Do not use or create cache\. See gts\-cache(7) for details\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-cache\fR
Do not use or create cache\. See gts\-cache(7) for details\.
.
.TP
\fB\-o <output>\fR, \fB\-\-output=<output>\fR
Output sequence file (specifying \fB\-\fR will force standard output)\. The output file format will be automatically detected from the filename if none is specified with the \fB\-F\fR or \fB\-\-format\fR option\.
