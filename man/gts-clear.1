.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
gts\-clear [\-\-version] [\-h | \-\-help] [\fIargs\fR] \fIseqin\fR
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBgts\-clear\fR takes a single sequence file input and strips off all features except for the \fBsource\fR features which are mandatory in GenBank\. If the sequence input is ommited, standard input will be read instead\. This command is equivalent to running \fBgts select source <seqin>\fR\.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB<seqin>\fR
Input sequence file (may be omitted if standard input is provided)\. See gts\-seqin(7) for a list of currently supported list of sequence formats\.
.
.TP
\fB\-F <format>\fR, \fB\-\-format=<format>\fR
Output file format (defaults to same as input)\. See gts\-seqout(7) for a list of currently supported list of sequence formats\. The format specified with this option will override the file type detection from the output filename\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-cache\fR
Do not use or create cache\. See gts\-cache(7) for details\.
.
.TP
\fB\-o <output>\fR, \fB\-\-output=<output>\fR
Output sequence file (specifying \fB\-\fR will force standard output)\. The output file format will be automatically detected from the filename if none is specified with the \fB\-F\fR or \fB\-\-format\fR option\.
.
.SH "BUGS"
\fBgts\-clear\fR currently has no known bugs\.
.
.SH "AUTHORS"
