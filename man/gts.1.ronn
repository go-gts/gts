# gts -- the genome transformation subprograms command line tool

## SYNOPSIS

usage: gts [--version] [-h | --help] <command> [<args>]

## DESCRIPTION

**GTS** provides basic manipulation utilities for genome flatfiles. The command
consists of a number of subcommands listed in the **COMMANDS** section.

## COMMANDS

  * `gts-annotate(1)`:
    Merge features from a feature list file into a sequence.

  * `gts-clear(1)`:
    Remove all features from the sequence (excluding source features).

  * `gts-complement(1)`:
    Compute the complement of the given sequence.

  * `gts-define(1)`:
    Define a new feature.

  * `gts-delete(1)`:
    Delete a region of the given sequence(s).

  * `gts-extract(1)`:
    Extract the sequences referenced by the features.

  * `gts-insert(1)`:
    Insert a sequence into another sequence(s).

  * `gts-join(1)`:
    Join the sequences contained in the files.

  * `gts-length(1)`:
    Report the length of the sequence(s).

  * `gts-pick(1)`:
    Pick sequence(s) from multiple sequences.

  * `gts-query(1)`:
    Query information from the given sequence.

  * `gts-repair(1)`:
    Repair fragmented features.

  * `gts-reverse(1)`:
    Reverse order of the given sequence(s).

  * `gts-rotate(1)`:
    Shift the coordinates of a circular sequence.

  * `gts-search(1)`:
    Search for a subsequence and annotate its results.

  * `gts-select(1)`:
    Select features using the given feature selector(s).

  * `gts-sort(1)`:
    Sort the list of sequences.

  * `gts-split(1)`:
    Split the sequence at the provided locations.

  * `gts-summary(1)`:
    Report a brief summary of the sequence(s).
